# VendChallenge

To download either click the download link under clone or download at the top right of the main repo page or type "git clone https://github.com/cam-shotter/VendChallenge" in your terminal.

I've included an express server which will run a local server at localhost:8080. To run, open the main folder in your terminal and type "npm i" to install all node modules, then "npm start" and go into localhost:8080 on your browser.

If you wish to make changes without having to restart the server each time type "npm run start:dev" in your terminal instead and a nodemon run server will start.
